                    A hard disk drive (HDD), hard disk, hard drive, or fixed disk is an electro-mechanical data storage device that uses magnetic storage to store and retrieve digital data 
                    <br/> 
                    using one or more rigid rapidly rotating platters coated with magnetic material. 
                    <br/>
                    The platters are paired with magnetic heads, usually arranged on a moving actuator arm, which read and write data to the platter surfaces.
                    <br/>
                    Data is accessed in a random-access manner, meaning that individual blocks of data can be stored and retrieved in any order. 
                    <br/>
                    HDDs are a type of non-volatile storage, retaining stored data even when powered off.

                    A solid-state drive (SSD) is a solid-state storage device that uses integrated circuit assemblies to store data persistently,
                    <br/> 
                    typically using flash memory, and functioning as secondary storage in the hierarchy of computer storage. 
                    <br/>
                    It is also sometimes called a solid-state device or a solid-state disk, 
                    <br/>
                    even though SSDs lack the physical spinning disks and movable readâ€“write heads used in hard drives ("HDD") or floppy disks.
