                also called a central processor, main processor or just processor, is the electronic circuitry within a computer that executes instructions that make up a computer program.
                The CPU performs basic arithmetic, logic, controlling, and input/output (I/O) operations specified by the instructions in the program.
                <br>The computer industry used the term "central processing unit" as early as 1955.
                <br>Traditionally, the term "CPU" refers to a processor, more specifically to its processing unit and control unit (CU),
                distinguishing these core elements of a computer from external components such as main memory and I/O circuitry.
                <br>The form, design, and implementation of CPUs have changed over the course of their history, but their fundamental operation remains almost unchanged. Principal components of a CPU include the arithmetic logic unit (ALU) that performs arithmetic and logic operations, processor registers that supply operands to the ALU and store the results of ALU operations, and a control unit that orchestrates the fetching (from memory) and execution of instructions by directing the coordinated operations of the ALU, registers and other components.
