                A central processing unit (CPU)
                is a form of computer memory that can be read and changed in any order, typically used to store working data and machine code.
                A random-access memory device allows data items to be read or written in almost the same amount of time irrespective of the physical location of data inside the memory.
                <br>In contrast, with other direct-access data storage media such as hard disks, CD-RWs, DVD-RWs and the older magnetic tapes and drum memory,
                <br>the time required to read and write data items varies significantly depending on their physical locations on the recording medium, due to mechanical limitations such as media rotation speeds and arm movement.
                <br>In today's technology, random-access memory takes the form of integrated circuit (IC) chips with MOS (metal-oxide-semiconductor) memory cells.
                RAM is normally associated with volatile types of memory (such as dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) modules),
                <br>where stored information is lost if power is removed, although non-volatile RAM has also been developed.
                Other types of non-volatile memories exist that allow random access for read operations, but either do not allow write operations or have other kinds of limitations on them.
